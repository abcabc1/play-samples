As a boy, Guana had a good relationship with the school cleaner. He called her “Nick” because she wore Nike shoes. The boy liked how Nike made everything clean. He told her he wanted to be a cleaner, too. “Well it’s good if you want to be a cleaner.” Nike told little Guana, “But make sure you go to college.”
Guana also looked up to the principal(校长) of his school. The school leader told the boy that his job was to help students and teachers. “Wow, when I grow up, I want to do what you’re doing.” Guana told him. “Well, if you stick to your dream, you will,” the principal replied.
And Guana really got there. But it was quite a long journey for him. Twenty-three years ago, he followed in Nike''s footsteps and was cleaning schools. He worked at three schools to pay for his college education. He held that job for four years and then worked his way up to being a school safety monitor. After that, he worked as a teacher for a few years.

Isn ''t  it boring? Do you get to meet famous actors? Does it pay well? My answers are pretty standard as well: Yes, sometimes, once in a while, and... kind of. The life of an extra is both more interesting and more boring than you might imagine.
Extras, who play the people in crowds, on streets, or in the background of indoors scenes, can come from all walks of life. Unlike many extras, I’m a trained actor. I do get real speaking roles, but work can be hard to come by if you re not a popular star. I’m registered(注册) with an agency that deals only with extras, so I get calls all the time. The agency explains who I''ll be - someone in a crowd, a member of a jury, a clerk - and tells me where to go. Call time is usually bright and early, so I try to get to bed at a reasonable hour,
Sometimes being an extra is a “hurry up and wait” job. In my first extra role, I was one of a group of office workers who come out of a building just as a car explodes (爆炸 ) in the street. We waited for hours for the scene to be shot, and then went in and out of the building about fifty times, trying to act terrified by an explosion which was not real. Then we had lunch, changed clothes, and spent the afternoons as customers in a department store.
It may sound like I don’t enjoy the work, but I do. Being part of the background in a convincing(令人信服的) way is challenging, and being on a film or TV set is always fascinating. A lot of famous actors don'' t even notice the extras, but the ones who do make the job a lot of fun for everyone. As for the money, it'' s nothing compared to what the big actors make, but it pretty much pays the bills.

    B. being an extra is always a " hurry up and wait" job

    D. those who want to be film or TV extras must be trained

A year later, he was leading a team of 100 scientists and engineers working on the invention. Slat needed money for this, so he started asking people to d  83    to his project online and raised over $ 2 million!
Soon after, Slat was named a “Champion of the Earth" by the United Nations for his meaningful and v  84   work. It''s the most important title the UN gives to people helping the environment.
